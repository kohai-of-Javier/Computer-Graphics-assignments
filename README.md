My development of the assignments for the course CC3501 at Universidad de Chile. They are written in Python using Pyglet.

## How to run the programs

1. Install and activate the Conda environment from (https://github.com/PLUMAS-research/cc3501-computer-graphics)[this repository].
2. Move the folder of the program you want to run to (https://github.com/PLUMAS-research/cc3501-computer-graphics)[the repository] directory.
3. Move to (https://github.com/PLUMAS-research/cc3501-computer-graphics)[the repository] directory from the command line.
4. Activate the Conda environment: `conda activate grafica`
