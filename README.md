# Computer-Graphics-assignments

My development of the assignments for the course CC3501 at Universidad de Chile. They are written in Python using Pyglet.

## How to run the programs

1. Install and activate the Conda environment from [this repository](https://github.com/PLUMAS-research/cc3501-computer-graphics) (from now, the teacher's repository).
2. Move the folder of the program you want to run to [the teacher's repository](https://github.com/PLUMAS-research/cc3501-computer-graphics) directory.
3. Move to [the teacher's repository](https://github.com/PLUMAS-research/cc3501-computer-graphics) directory from the command line.
4. Activate the Conda environment: `conda activate grafica`
5. Run: `python -m PROGRAM_FOLDER` where PROGRAM_FOLDER is the name of the folder of the program you want to run.
